     Custom Environment that follows the gym interface for the board game 'Rising Sun'

     It takes two players from the Players class to initialize a game. The game is played
     in 1v1. Both players have a simultaneous action (in the RL sense of the term) that is
     the number of golds used on each of the game actions (not in the RL sense of the term)
     These game actions are assigned to each player and applied automatically according to
     the 'gold actions' of the players. The four game actions are coded at the end of the
     class.
